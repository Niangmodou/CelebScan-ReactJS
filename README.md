# CelebScan-App

CelebScan is a React JS app that uses the Clarifai API to return the name of a 
celebrity of your choice. The user enters a URL and an image of the url
is displayed onto the app. A name and a percent accuracy is also returned
and displayed.

A possible improvement that may be added to this app is a facial recignition
box is displayed onto the returned image.

There are a total of five components within this app: 
- The Header
- The Url form and the Search button
- The Celebrity Image Area
- The Text Area
- The Footer
